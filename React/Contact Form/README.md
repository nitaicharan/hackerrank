## Detailed Requirements

1. The `Slides` component takes an array of slides as a prop. Each element of this array denotes a single slide and is an object with two properties: a string `title` and a string `text`.
2. When the application loads, the first slide must be rendered.
3. Clicking on the **"Next"** button shows the next slide. This button should be disabled when the current slide is the last one.
4. Clicking on the **"Prev"** button shows the previous slide. This button should be disabled when the current slide is the first one.
5. Clicking on the **"Restart"** button returns to the first slide. This button should be disabled when the current slide is the first one.
6. You can assume that the passed slides array contains at least one slide.
